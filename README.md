# [tic tac toe](https://oldbettie.github.io/tictactoe/)

## Project Zero

The first project for SEIR-52 was to build a functioning tic tac toe game. My minimalistic styling gives the game a very clean feel and means the screen is easy to read and navigate.

Being my first actual project without assistance i was confident in my skills, I tried not to refactor it too much so as to set a level for my skill progression moving forward.

## Implementation

This project was made using HTML/CSS, Javascript and jQuery. Some of the fun things was implementing the light or dark mode toggle button and messing with an auto reset vs click to reset.

## Bugs

still need to implement a media query for smaller screens i spent some time working with the fonts to auto resize on smaller windows but had some issues will implement a media query to do this for me.
