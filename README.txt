#Overview


We'll be making Tic Tac Toe, a game that takes seconds to learn but minutes to master! Everyone will get a chance to be creative, and work through some really tough programming challenges to get your feet wet in the world of web development.

#Big Goals
Build a web application from scratch, without a starter codebase
Use your programming skills to map out the game logic for a simple game like Tic Tac Toe
Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in your application
Build a dynamic game that allows two players to compete
Craft a readme.md file that explains your app to the world

#Technical Requirements
Your app must:

Render a game board in the browser
Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select)
Visually display which side won if a player gets three in a row or show a draw/"cat’s game" if neither wins
Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
Use Javascript for DOM manipulation
Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

#Bonus
These are for extra credit! Don't focus on these until you've hit the core requirements.

Keep track of multiple game rounds with a win counter
Allow players to customize their tokens (X, O, name, picture, etc)
Get inventive with your styling, e.g. use hover effects or animations to spiff things up
Use LocalStorage to persist data locally to allow games to continue after page refresh or loss of internet connectivity
Support custom board sizes: default is 3x3 but you could allow users to choose a larger board
Support networked multiplayer: https://www.firebase.com/ has a nice quickstart guide
TRICKIEST: Create an AI opponent: teach Javascript to play an unbeatable game against you

#Necessary Deliverables
A working game, built by you, hosted somewhere on the internet
A link to your hosted working game in the URL section of your Github repo
A git repository hosted on Github, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
A readme.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

#Suggested Ways to Get Started
Break the project down into different components (data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually. Use whiteboards!
Use your Development Tools (console.log, inspector, alert statements, etc) to debug and solve problems
Work through the lessons in class, ask questions and come to office hours when you need to. Think about adding relevant code to your Tic Tac Toe game each night, instead of, you know... procrastinating.
Commit early, commit often. Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
Check out Tutorial and Documentation resources (jQuery tutorial) at home to better understand what you’ll be getting into.
Don’t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later. Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if you’re trying to figure out how to change some text when the game is over but you haven’t solved the win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.

#If You Finish Early
We invite you to work on any or all of the following:

A more advanced game (Memory? Battleship? Connect Four?)
Your Github portfolio site
Any other front-end project that interests you
